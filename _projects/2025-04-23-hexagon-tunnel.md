A shimmering tunnel of light, where ethereal music surrounds you through noise-canceling headphones and a choreographed light show unfolds before your eyes—an otherworldly experience to share with a buddy or savor on your own.

This piece is a 1-meter long tube lined with LEDs that displays patterns and visualizations choreographed to music. Two people sit at opposite ends of the tube, put on noise-cancelling headphones, and gaze into the tube and across at their buddy at the other end of the tube. A music track starts playing and they watch the show until the song is over. There are 7 tracks to choose from, each with different choreography, including a few tracks from the Interstellar movie soundtrack. The piece can either be experienced with a buddy or on your own.

This piece was built as a prototype for a much larger (15x30 ft) version that made an appearance at Electric Forest in 2024. More info on the Electric Forest piece (plus a video!) can be found here: [https://mickymakes.art/installations/hexagon](https://mickymakes.art/installations/hexagon)
