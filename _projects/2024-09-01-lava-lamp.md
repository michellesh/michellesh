This piece offers the peaceful glow of a lava lamp through a circular viewport. Undulating shapeless blobs of light evolve naturally and organically, yet the software algorithm originates from an erratic mess of random numbers. The code uses a Simplex noise algorithm, which transforms random values into smoothly varying gradients of color and brightness. The LED code is custom written and running on an ESP32 microcontroller.

The physical structure is crafted with steel and walnut. The process began with 3D modeling, followed by cutting out the shape of the wood panel and holes in the steel tubes with a CNC router. Segments of LED strip are hidden inside each steel tube and soldered together into a continuous chain. The stability of the materials aims to balance the spontaneity and fluidity of the underlying programming
